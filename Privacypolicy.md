# Privacy Policy for Link Reveal Extension


	This extension reads the current web pages and extracts link information. It uses the JavaScript code `document.getElementsByTagName("a")` to get a list of all HTML code that defines the anchor elements on the web page. The extension processes this data, and immediately provides a popup summarizing this data to the user, ensuring a seamless and efficient experience. 

	The extension does not save, send, or otherwise transport the data out of the context of the popup page. It gathers it only to help the user see the data behind the links they might click.

	No promotional emails or connections to the user will arise from using this extension.  The data will not be shared in any way with anyone except the extension user when they use the extension.
